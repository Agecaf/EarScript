# EarScript Specification.

Todo: Table of contents.


## Introduction

This is the language specification for the EarScript programming language.
This specification is intended for anyone interested in
implementing EarScript machines and compilers. 

EarScript is a  domain specific language which only supports integers,
and excels at procedural generation.

It is easy to parse, and virtual machines that run EarScript 
can be very easy to customize, making EarScript potentially
a good option for a scripting language that is compiled at runtime.


### Overview

EarScript's machines contain **tables**, each is a 2 dimensional array of integers.
Each table has a **pen**, which points at one position within the table.
The machine also keeps track of which **table** is currently being used.

EarScript's code primarily has instructions to manipulate these tables,
through movement of the pen, and manipulation of the numbers the pen points to.

Other than table manipulation, EarScript also has many instructions to manipulate
the control flow of its code. 
These broadly use `()` for `if/else`-like conditional control flow,
`[]` for `for/while`-like loop control flow,
and `{}` for `switch`-like branching control flow.


### Use Cases

EarScript should be easy to embed into applications, where virtual machines can be made to sandbox the execution of EarScript code.

EarScript was first implemented to be used in the rhythm game 
[EternAlgoRhythm](https://www.agecaf.eu/eternalgorhythm.html)
to procedurally generate music and charts.
Each note's pitch, velocity, duration, time of occurrence
and note type, were represented by integers, and were generated by EarScript code.

EarScript should be useful to generate anything that, like musical notes,
can be represented by integers.


### Preliminary examples

As an equivalent to "Hello World" program, we simply output the number from which all meaning can be derived.
```
# This is a comment
=42. # Output: 42
```

In this program, we output the numbers from 1 to 10.
```
[10 +.]
# Output: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.
```

In this program, we infinitely output consecutive integers,
which randomly go up or down.
```
[i{r+|-}.]
# Example output: 1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 2, 1, 0, 1, 0, ...
```
