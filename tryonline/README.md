# EarScript JS 

This is an implementation of the EarScript programming language
made in JavaScript.

The purpose of this implementation is to create a way for
users to try EarScript code online.

The code editor used is [CodeJar](https://github.com/antonmedv/codejar),
which was really easy to implement the syntax highlighting for
compared to other code editors I looked for,
however it seems to have some technical issues on Firefox.
